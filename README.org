#+title: Spack packages for Wire-Cell

This repo holds a Spack ~package.py~ to build ~wire-cell-toolkit~ and a
few others that have yet to be PR'ed to Spack, proper.   To use:

- [[https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation][Install Spack.]]  We need post-0.17.1 ~develop~ branch ca March 2022.

- Clone this git repo and add it as a Spack repo:

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-spack.git wct-spack
spack repo add wct-spack
#+end_example

- Install the "core" ~wire-cell-toolkit~ support and its externals:

  #+begin_example
spack install wire-cell-toolkit
  #+end_example

- Or, in addition, install the optional support by specifying one or
  more variants which you can discover with:

#+begin_example
spack info wire-cell-toolkit
#+end_example

For example:

#+begin_example
spack install wire-cell-toolkit+root
#+end_example
